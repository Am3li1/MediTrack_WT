# MediTrack_MERN

MediTrack_MERN is a web application designed to store and manage medical records of donor patients, accessible by doctors. This application leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) for full-stack development.

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB (either Compass or Atlas) installed on your machine. You can download them from their respective websites.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:
1. **frontend**: Contains the React.js code for the user interface.
2. **backend**: Contains the Express.js code for the server and API.

## Dependencies

### Backend
Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install express nodemon mongoose cors
```

### Frontend
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm install react-router-dom axios react-icons
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Backend**: Open a terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory, and start the server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```

2. **Frontend**: Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and start the React development server:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Once both servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser. The frontend will typically be served at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:5000` or the port specified in your backend configuration.
